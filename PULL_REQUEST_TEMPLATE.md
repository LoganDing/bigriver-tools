## General
- [ ] All new and existing tests passed.
- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes.
- [ ] I have linted all the json and yaml files touched in this PR to confirm they parse correctly.
- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. Please include link(s) to changed/added documentation.
- [ ] My code follows the code style of this project.

## Scripts
- [ ] I have run `pylint` on all python files touched in my branch.
- [ ] I have run `rubocop` on all ruby files touched in my branch.
- [ ] I have run `shellcheck` on all shell scripts touched in my branch.
- [ ] All scripts touched in this PR have valid shebang lines and are marked executable. Humans should never be typing `interpreter script-path`, that is what shebangs are for. 
- [ ] Any scripts added in my PR do not include language extensions in their names - no `foo.sh`, `foo.rb` or `foo.py`. We do not want to have to change other scripts just because something gets rewritten in a better fitting language.
