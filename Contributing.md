# Contributing

First and foremost, thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions.

## To add to the list:

### Submit a pull request.

* Script Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
* The script descriptions should be in alphabetical order.
* If the script is not Apache 2.0 licensed, there's a link in the script comments at the top of the script to the license it is under.
* Links should be named the name of the script or project.
* Your PR should pass the Travis checks. If the travis results show an error that you didn't add (a previous resource link has gone 404, for example) you don't _have_ to fix those errors, though I'll appreciate the help if you do.
* It is fine to have multiple new entries in a single PR.
* No need to squash commits. It is fine to have multiple commits in a PR.

## To remove an entry:

Open an issue to discuss why the entry should be removed, and optionally create a PR.
